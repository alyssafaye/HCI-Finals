                  <p>
                   - a 17 years old girl from Manila living a simple and average life who has infinite dreams. It’s her ambition to get as much life out of living as she possibly can - as much enjoyment, as much interest, as much experience, as much understanding. She loves to draw, photography, film and anything art related.

                   This blog is all about myself, everything I desire and to whom i share my memories with.
